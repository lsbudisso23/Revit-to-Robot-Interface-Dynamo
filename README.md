# Revit-to-Robot-Interface

[Dynamo](https://primer.dynamobim.org/index.html) (open source visual programming platform) compatible script to automatically export the active document in Autodesk Revit 2022 to Autodesk Robot Structural Analysis 2022.

This repo only tracks the code and does not provide a develpment environment - this code must be inserted into a Dynamo workspace under a python script (CPython3 engine) block.

For further information on using this python script with Autodesk Revit (and Dynamo) see [Python and Revit](https://primer.dynamobim.org/10_Custom-Nodes/10-5_Python-Revit.html)
